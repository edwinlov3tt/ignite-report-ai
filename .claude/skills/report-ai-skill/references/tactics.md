### Key Metrics

### Optimization Focus
1. **Frequency capping critical** - diminishing returns above 3-5x/week
2. **Segment by recency** - 1-7 days vs 8-30 days for bid adjustments
3. **Dynamic creative** - typically outperforms static for products
4. **Exclude converters** - avoid wasted spend on recent buyers

### Warning Signs

|-------|-----------|--------|
| Audience fatigue | Frequency >5x/week | Reduce frequency cap |
| Ad fatigue | Declining CTR trend | Refresh creative |
| Saturation | Increasing CPA, flat volume | Expand audience |
| Attribution issues | Same users converting multiple times | Check exclusions |

### Expected Performance
- 2-3x better CPA/ROAS vs prospecting
- 3-5x higher conversion rate than cold traffic
- Minimum audience size: 10K+ for most platforms
